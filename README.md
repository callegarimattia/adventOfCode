# Advent of Code

This is some shenanigans code for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge.  
Please don't take this too seriously, the code is not meant to be good or efficient, it's just for fun and learning.

- [2023](/2023) was solved with Python.
- [2024](/2024) will be solved with Go.
